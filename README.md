# Weather App

**Name**: Rikio's 5 day weather app

Description and usage: This weather app is to be used to check the forecast for cities around the world. A user should type in the city they want to search for and press the enter key to kick off the search process. Once the user has searched for a city from the landing page, they will be taken to a results page. This results page should show the name of the city and current weather for the city. The page should also show various weather stats for the next 5 days for that same city. The city should also pop up on the left hand column as a recently searched quick button for easy re-searching. This side panel only holds the 5 most recently searched cities. If a city name has more than one actual city attributed to it, the app will return the most popular city based on searches.
